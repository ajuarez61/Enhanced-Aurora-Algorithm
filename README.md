# Enhanced-Aurora-Algorithm

This program was created in Jupyter Notebook for my research project done as a part of the ASSURE REU at the Space Sciences Laboratory. It detects Enhanced Aurora, highlighting candidates that last at least 5 minutes and are within the top 20% of green/blue ratios in the month of February 2023. 

At the end of the program, it displays 3 keograms: green wavelegnths, blue wavelenghts, and a ratio keogram with notable Enhanced Aurora candidates.
